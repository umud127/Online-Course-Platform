– What is the project?
It's an Online Course Platform.

– What is the project for?
The platform is designed for educational purposes. Students can watch and learn from available courses, while teachers can create and manage their own courses.

– What is the advantage of this project?
This project can serve as a foundation for any course-based platform, thanks to its flexible and modular architecture. One of its most unique features is the Teacher Request & Admin Response system — a mechanism you likely haven't seen elsewhere. 

– What does that mean?
To ensure content quality and platform security, we implemented a request–response system.

Teachers cannot create a course directly.
Instead, they must submit a request including their credentials, course idea, and an explanation.
Our admin panel evaluates the request:

If approved, the user becomes a teacher and can start creating courses.

If rejected, the admin sends a custom feedback message explaining why the request was denied.

This approach ensures that only qualified and approved teachers can contribute, maintaining a high standard of content for students.
